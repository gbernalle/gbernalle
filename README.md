# Hello, I'm Gabriel Bernalle! 👋
### 🚀 Aspiring Data Engineer | Computer Engineering Student @ CEFET-MG

I am a Computer Engineering student transitioning from **Full Stack/BI** to **Data Engineering**. My passion goes beyond just visualizing data; I focus on building the robust and performant architecture that makes insights possible.

Currently, I am focused on building resilient data pipelines, optimizing ingestion processes, and applying **Software Engineering principles** to the data world.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building Now (Capstone Project)

### 🇧🇷 End-to-End Data Pipeline: Brazilian Micro-Entrepreneurship Analysis

I am developing a complete **ETL & NLP** solution to investigate the socio-economic context of micro-entrepreneurs (MEI) in Brazil. I am using unstructured social media data (Reddit) and cross-referencing it with official government statistics.

**Architecture & Highlights:**
* **Ingestion (Bronze Layer):** Developed a high-performance asynchronous extractor in **Python** (`concurrent.futures`) to consume the Reddit API.
    * *Result:* **8x** speed optimization in data collection compared to sequential methods.
* **Orchestration:** Managing complex data flows using **Mage-AI**.
* **Transformation & NLP (Silver Layer):** Semantic cleaning and topic classification using **BERT** models (Hugging Face) for Sentiment Analysis and Zero-Shot Classification.
* **Infrastructure:** Fully containerized environment with **Docker**.

## 💼 Real-World Experience & Impact

While seeking my first official role as a Junior Data Engineer, I already apply performance engineering in the corporate world:

* **ArcelorMittal Brasil (Analytics Intern):** Reduced the runtime of a critical data collection process from **8 minutes to 1 minute** (800% gain) by implementing parallelism and multithreading in Python.
* **Teknisa (Full Stack Intern):** Optimized complex **SQL** queries in CRM modules, significantly reducing database load and response times.
